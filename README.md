# ATES-Unet-Predictor
This repository houses a U-Net based deep learning model designed to estimate the production temperature and temperature field in Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES) systems. 

Code can be tested by:
1) Unzip the temperature fields data
2) Start building the scalers
3) Start the model training process
